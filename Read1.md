## Hello all in my first repasitory which i named READ.
in the first i need to talk about the **benifites** of using command line *"CMD".
CMD* is : 

*A text-based user interface to the computer. The command line is a blank line and cursor on the screen, allowing the user to type in instructions for immediate execution. All major operating systems (Windows, Mac, Unix, Linux, etc.) 

 After typing a command, it is executed by pressing the Enter key.
we can access many files in PC more easly about search and ohter way.
all file have type such as: **docs, exe, etc**.*

in my opinion the CMD is a good thing you are learned beacuse it makes something more easy and more efficint in works.
I will be thanks to saja to installed it and thanks to walid to learn us the command line.
we have may types of command example :

***A*- ls : "LISTED"**

**B*- PWD : "print he place of works."*

***C*- cd : "Changing the located"**

**D*- mv : Move places of files*
