Hello all in my first repasitory which i named READ. in the first i need to talk about the benifites of using command line "CMD". CMD is : A text-based user interface to the computer. The command line is a blank line and cursor on the screen, allowing the user to type in instructions for immediate execution. All major operating systems (Windows, Mac, Unix, Linux, etc.) ... After typing a command, it is executed by pressing the Enter key. we can access many files in PC more easly about search and ohter way. all file have type such ass >>> docs, exe, etc. in my opinion the CMD is a good thing you are learned beacuse it makes something more easy and more efficint in works. I will be thanks to saja to installed it and thanks to walid to learn us the command line. we have may types of command example : A- ls : "LISTED" B- PWD : "print he place of works."
