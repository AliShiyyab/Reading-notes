# Welcome in JavaScript
**Whats The JS?**
* JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language
* JavaScript is the programming language of the Web
* JavaScript is easy to learn
* This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.
* We use Script tags to can be access to methods.

## JavaScript Statements are composed of:
  * Values
  * Operators
  * Expressions
  * Keywords
  * Comments


>In JS The ';' Is very important in the last programing statment.




>## Keyword	Description
TAB1 | Tab2
----------------| ----------------------------------------------------------
break	|Terminates a switch or a loop
continue|	Jumps out of a loop and starts at the top|
debugger|	Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function
do ... while	|Executes a block of statements, and repeats the block, while a condition is true for	Marks a block of statements to be executed, as long as a condition is true
function	| Declares a function
if ... else	| Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on a condition
return|	Exits a function
switch|	Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on different cases
try ... catch	|Implements error handling to a block of statements
var|	Declares a variable
notes | If we need to add notes we can use '/*  **Body note**  */'

*In The other Programing language, When you are declare a variable, you should be declare the variable type such as **" INT , DOUBLE , FLOAT , BOOL , ARRAY's ... etc "** bu in The ***(javascript)*** we can use only **var** to declare any variable for any types* 

>Example:
* var TA = 'Saja';     -> This is String data Type.
* var GPA = 69.7;      -> This is double data type.
* var temp = true;     -> This boolean data type. 

## JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

>Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

Operator	|   Description

'+'         |	Addition
'-'         |   Subtraction
'*'         | 	Multiplication
'**'    	|   Exponentiation (ES2016)
'/'	        |   Division
'%'         |	Modulus (Division Remainder)
'++'	    |   Increment
'--'	    |   Decrement


>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

Operator	|   Example     |	Same As
----------- | ------------- | -------------
=	        |   x = y       |   x = y
+=          |	x += y      |	x = x + y
-=	        |   x -= y      |   x = x - y
*=          |	x *= y	    |   x = x * y
/=          |	x /= y      |	x = x / y
%=          |	x %= y      |	x = x % y
**=	        |   x **= y     |	x = x ** y
